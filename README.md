Developer Guidlines:
“The project is structured mainly using Managers, each holding the references and content needed by that specific manager. The main file simply calls these references. Every Manager includes the basic functions Update, Draw, and Free. If you need to change values, you should edit the individual base files and not the Manager itself (except for the SeaSpriteManager and UIManager, which contains multiple sprites). The Raylib library handles collisions, drawing, keyboard input and AudioDevice.”
